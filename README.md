# Sepsis Survival Prediction
Although many classification tasks can be with today’s LLMs, the have 2 key limitations. One,
they may not perform so well when the input data are not text-based. And two, their huge
compute costs can be restrictive. This is why it is still important for AI practitioners to
understand traditional machine learning techniques. One of the most widely used is the
Random forest. Here’s a simple project using one to predict the survival of sepsis patients:
